## 🎨 **How to Play**

1. 👥 **Create/Join a Room:** Enter your username, create a new game room, or join an existing one.
2. 📝 **Make Your Move:** Click on a square to make your move. Be strategic! Each player can only have three marks on the board at any time. When you place your fourth mark, your oldest one disappears! 😱
3. 🏁 **Win or Draw:** First to align 3 marks wins the game! If all squares are filled and no winner, it’s a draw! 🤝
4. 🔄 **Game History:** Review who won, how many moves it took, and more!

## 🎉 **Winning Strategy**

- 🚀 **Plan Ahead:** You lose your oldest mark when placing your fourth, so make sure your three marks are always working for you!
- 🧠 **Think Fast:** Every move matters in this strategic twist!
- 🏆 **Outplay Your Opponent:** Keep an eye on the board, and don’t let those moves fade away into oblivion! 🌀

## 💡 Code Structure Highlights & Refinements

To enhance modularity and maintainability, the codebase incorporates several key design patterns and separations of concerns:

-   **`src/hooks/useGame.js`**: This is the central nervous system for the game's client-side logic.
    -   It manages the complete game state, including the board, current player, turn count, scores, and history.
    -   It handles player moves (`handleMove`), validates them, and updates the state accordingly.
    -   It integrates with Firebase (via `firebaseUtils.js`) to send and receive real-time game updates.
    -   It encapsulates complex actions like resetting the game (`resetGame`).
    -   Helper functions within this hook, such as `updateScoresAndHistory`, further break down specific tasks.

-   **`src/utils/gameLogic.js`**: This module houses the pure, reusable logic that defines the rules of Fading Tic-Tac-Toe.
    -   `checkWinner`: Determines if a winning combination exists.
    -   `applyFadingRule`: Implements the unique "fading mark" mechanic, removing a player's oldest mark when they place their fourth mark.
    -   `calculateHighlightCell`: Identifies which cell will fade next for the current player.
    -   `getNextPlayer`: Manages turn progression.
    -   `isGameOver`: Checks for game completion conditions.
    -   Keeping this logic separate ensures that the game rules are testable and independent of the UI or state management framework.

-   **`src/utils/firebaseUtils.js`**: All direct interactions with the Firebase Firestore database are consolidated here. This includes creating game rooms, allowing players to join, and updating the game state in real-time.

-   **`src/components/constants.js`**: Defines shared constants like winning combinations, initial game state, and player markers (`PLAYER_X`, `PLAYER_O`) to ensure consistency and avoid magic values.

This separation helps in making the code easier to understand, test, and extend.
